Learning BPM is a collection of my thoughts, learnings and related stuff as I help businesses implement ProcessMaker Workflow and BPM solution.

BPM stands for Business Process Management and often refers to both the methodology and the technology. For the purpose of this blog, we will more often than not be referring to the technology and [ProcessMaker](https://www.processmaker.com/) in particular.

Interested in learning more about the methodology, you can check out this article on AIIM - [What is BPM?](http://www.aiim.org/What-is-BPM).

As you read, I would really appreciate your feedback in the comments so I can learn from your experiences also. Cheers!!!
